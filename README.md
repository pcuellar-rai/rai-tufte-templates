# RAI Tufte Templates
This repository includes the necessary files to run a customized version of the LaTeX versions of Edward Tufte's handouts and long reports. Original code can be found in the [Tufte LaTeX repo](https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex).

## Quick Start
You can locally build the project (e.g., using VS Code) or import this repo into Overleaf. RAI's approved branding assets are included in the [sections](https://github.com/pcuellar-bdai/rai-tufte-templates/tree/main/sections) folder.  


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors of the form,

    ! LaTeX Error: File `paralist.sty' not found.

you will need to obtain missing packages from [CTAN](http://ctan.org).
For package installation instructions and answers to many other
questions, see the [UK TeX FAQ](http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq/) or search the [`comp.text.tex` group](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex).

The following packages are required:

 * biber
 * biblatex
 * chngpage or changepage
 * fancyhdr
 * fontenc
 * geometry
 * hyperref
 * metalogo
 * optparams
 * paralist
 * placeins
 * ragged2e
 * subfiles
 * setspace
 * textcase
 * textcomp
